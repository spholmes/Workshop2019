                  providing nourishment, regulating epithelial development, and
                  instructing innate immunity; yet, surprisingly, basic features remain
                  poorly described. We examined 13,355 prokaryotic ribosomal RNA gene
                  sequences from multiple colonic mucosal sites and feces of healthy
                  subjects to improve our understanding of gut microbial diversity. A
                  majority of the bacterial sequences corresponded to uncultivated species
                  and novel microorganisms. We discovered significant intersubject
                  variability and differences between stool and mucosa community
                  composition. Characterization of this immensely diverse ecosystem is the
                  first step in elucidating its role in health and disease.},

  Abstract =	 {We address the problem of using expression data and prior biological
                  knowledge to identify differentially expressed pathways or groups of
                  genes. Following an idea of Ideker et al. (2002), we construct a gene
                  interaction network and search for high-scoring subnetworks. We make
                  several improvements in terms of scoring functions and algorithms,
                  resulting in higher speed and accuracy and easier biological
                  interpretation. We also assign significance levels to our results,
                  adjusted for multiple testing. Our methods are successfully applied to
                  three human microarray data sets, related to cancer and the immune
                  system, retrieving several known and potential pathways. The method,
                  denoted by the acronym GXNA (Gene eXpression Network Analysis) is
                  implemented in software that is publicly available and can be used on
                  virtually any microarray data set. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The source

                  multidimensional scaling applied to a specific dataset: the 2005 United
                  States House of Representatives roll call votes. MDS and kernel
                  projections output `horseshoes' that are characteristic of
                  dimensionality reduction techniques. We show that in general, a latent
                  ordering of the data gives rise to these patterns when one only has
                  local information. That is, when only the interpoint distances for
                  nearby points are known accurately. Our results provide a rigorous set
                  of results and insight into manifold learning in the special case where
                  the manifold is a curve.},

                  presented. The component-specific parameters in the regression models
                  are estimated using regularized likelihood methods. The advantages of
                  the regularization are that (i) the pre-specified maximum degrees of
                  freedom for the splines is less crucial than for unregularized
                  estimation and that (ii) for each component individually a suitable
                  degree of freedom is selected in an automatic way. The performance is
                  evaluated in a simulation study with artificial data as well as on a
                  yeast cell cycle dataset of gene expression levels over

  Abstract =	 {This paper poses the problem of estimating and validating phylogenetic
                  trees in statistical terms. The problem is hard enough to warrant
                  several tacks: we reason by analogy to rounding real numbers, and
                  dealing with ranking data. These are both cases where, as in phylogeny
                  the parameters of interest are not real numbers. Then we pose the
                  problem in geometrical terms, using distances and measures on a natural
                  space of trees. We do not solve the problems of inference on tree space,
                  but suggest some coherent ways of tackling them. },

  abstract =	 {We introduce a general technique for making statistical inference from
                  clustering tools applied to gene expression microarray data. The
                  approach utilizes an analysis of variance model to achieve normalization
                  and estimate differential expression of genes across multiple
                  conditions. Statistical inference is based on the application of a
                  randomization technique, bootstrapping. Bootstrapping has previously
                  been used to obtain confidence intervals for estimates of differential
                  expression for individual genes. Here we apply bootstrapping to assess
                  the stability of results from a cluster analysis. We illustrate the
                  technique with a publicly available data set and draw conclusions about
                  the reliability of clustering results in light of variation in the
                  data. The bootstrapping procedure relies on experimental replication. We
                  discuss the implications of replication and good design in microarray
                  experiments.  },

  Abstract =	 {The diversity of a species assemblage has been studied extensively for
                  many decades in relation to its possible connection with ecosystem
                  functioning and organization. In this view most diversity measures, such
                  as Shannon's entropy, rely upon information the ory as a basis for the
                  quantification of diversity. Also, traditional diversity measures are
                  computed using species relative abundances and cannot account for the
                  ecological differences between species. Rao first proposed a diversity
                  index, termed quadratic diversity (Q ) that incorporates both species
                  relative abundances and pairwise distances between species. Quadratic
                  diversity is traditionally defin ed as the expected distance between two
                  randomly selected individuals. In this paper, we show that quadratic
                  diversity can be interpret ed as the expected conflict among the species
                  of a given assemblage. From this unusual interpretation, it naturally
                  follows that Rao's Q can be related to the Shannon entropy through a
                  generalized version of the Tsallis parametric entropy.},

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: A number of available program packages determine the
                  significant enrichments and/or depletions of GO categories among a class
                  of genes of interest. Whereas a correct formulation of the problem leads
                  to a single exact n ull distribution, these GO tools use a large variety
                  of statistical tests whose denominations often do not clarify the un
                  derlying P-value computations. SUMMARY: We review the different
                  formulations of the problem and the tests they lead to: t he binomial,
                  chi2, equality of two probabilities, Fisher's exact and hypergeometric
                  tests. We clarify the relationships e xisting between these tests, in
                  particular the equivalence between the hypergeometric test and Fisher's
                  exact test. We re call that the other tests are valid only for large
                  samples, the test of equality of two probabilities and the chi2-test b
                  eing equivalent. We discuss the appropriateness of one- and two-sided
                  P-values, as well as some discreteness and conserva tism
                  issues. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at
                  Bioinformatics online.},

  Abstract =	 {We have applied "whole-genome shotgun sequencing" to microbial
                  populations collected en masse on tangential flow and impact filters
                  from seawater samples collected from the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda. A
                  total of 1.045 billion base pairs of nonredundant sequence was
                  generated, annotated, and analyzed to elucidate the gene content,
                  diversity, and relative abundance of the organisms within these
                  environmental samples. These data are estimated to derive from at least
                  1800 genomic species based on sequence relatedness, including 148
                  previously unknown bacterial phylotypes. We have identified over 1.2
                  million previously unknown genes represented in these samples, including
                  more than 782 new rhodopsin-like photoreceptors. Variation in species
                  present and stoichiometry suggests substantial oceanic microbial
                  diversity.},
